## PALINDROME OF A STRING

Explanation
In this program, we need to check whether a given string is palindrome or not.

Example:

```
MADAM
```

A string is said to be palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward. For e.g. above string is a palindrome because if we read it the reverse of the word gives the same output. 

Good Luck!!
